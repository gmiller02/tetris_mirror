tetris README

Handin: This is my final handin

My Tetris has the following classes: App, PaneOrganizer, Piece, Constants, Tetris, and Tetrisquare. They are organized
in the following ways:

App instantiates my PaneOrganizer class.
PaneOrganizer creates an instance of my Tetris class, which is my game class.
Tetris contains an instance variable of my Piece class and the EventHandlers that are responsible for running the game.
It also contains an array made up of TetrisSquares that makes up my board.
Piece contains two arrays made up of my class TetrisSquare- one that is an instance of the board, and one that makes up
my pieces.
TetrisSquare does not contain any classes.

Design Choices:
For the most part, I don't think I used any code that varied widely from the assigned psuedocode.

Known Bugs: I have no known bugs.

Hours: This project took around 30 hours to complete.
